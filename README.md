# C# Utilities

_That "other" blue soda can, when you already have a red can and a blue can to choose from._

## ðŸŽ‰ **v1.0.0 NOW AVAILABLE!!!** ðŸŽ‰

_versions 0.6.0 - 0.7.34 were busted... yeah, sorry about that_ :(

This extension provides some helpful features to _hopefully_ speed up your workflow when developing .net applications in VSCode.

Features currently include:

- Adding a class/interface/etc from the Explorer side bar
- Managing project references
- Not collecting any data.

## Features

### Add C# Item

Add a new C# file from the Explorer view.

This menu is available when you right-click a `.cs` file, a `.csproj` file, or a folder.

Currently the following types of items are supported:

- Class
- Interface
- Record
- Enum
- Struct

#### **Note: When Adding an Item**

- If you attempt to add an item by right-clicking a file/directory that is **not** inside a directory that contains a `.csproj` file (or subdirectory thereof), you will be alerted as such.

- The namespace is derived from either the `Project -> PropertyGroup -> RootNamespace` element in the `.csproj` file (if specified) or the project name. The namespace will have sub-namespacing that respects the folder tree.

  - If multiple `PropertyGroup` elements exist in the `.csproj` file with differing `RootNamespace` values, it will defer to the project name.

### Manage Project References

Right-clicking a `.csproj` file gives your the option to "Manage Project References..." which will open a menu showing all available projects in the workspace, with the ones already referenced being checked.

Simply check the projects you wish to reference and uncheck the ones you don't.

#### **Note: When Managing Project References**

- If a circular reference would be created from this action, an error will be displayed and it will be aborted.

- This feature does not manually edit the `.csproj` file - it actually executes the commands in an integrated terminal instance. So, if things do not go as you expect, check your integrated terminal named `dotnet` for any weirdness, and, please, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/revrenlove/CSharpUtilities/issues/new).

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code v1.65.0 or higher.
- .NET 5+ or .NET Core SDK

## Upcoming Features

- Ability to add/remove C# projects.
- Project reference tree view
- Option for C#10 syntax features in new item templates

## To answer the question... "Why?"

There are several popular extensions available that attempt to achieve what this extension attempts to achieve... I just haven't found one that ticks the following boxes:

- Actively maintained
- Bug-free
- Lightweight
- Not trying to do "too much"

So, I decided I'll make my own C# extension... [with blackjack... and hookers](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/im-going-to-build-my-own-theme-park-with-blackjack-and-hookers).\*
