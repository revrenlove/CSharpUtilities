## Automated Testing

It is recommended to do the development work in an instance of `code-insiders` that way the tests can run in an instance if `code`. [Further Reading...](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension#tips)

## Repo Git Strategy and CI/CD

TODO: Come up with a coherent strategy.
